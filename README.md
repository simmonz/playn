# playn
Various [PlayN](http://playn.io) demos that were written for a section of CSCI 490 taught at Drury University in the Spring of 2016.

Click on the folders to see a short description of that demo.

To get started with [PlayN](http://playn.io), see [Setup](http://playn.io/docs/setup.html) which covers building for
Java, Android, iOS, and HTML5 backends.

See [CygwinMavenSetUp.pdf](CygwinMavenSetUp.pdf) to set up a PlayN development environment using the Maven build system,
by hand, on Windows in Cygwin.
